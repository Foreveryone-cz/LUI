# LUI - Less UI
Less UI repo - responsive UI elements and mixins collection

This repo cointains basic UI elements that most websites need. 
From stuff like error messages all the way to responsive forms and tables. If you like your own UI stuff, you can just use mixin collection to make your life easier :)

**Awesome grid system**
- able to set both vertical and horizontal position of columns (!!!)
- more resolutions, but if you dont need responsive, you can simply use static grid (!)
- extra columns size for print (!!)
- need 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 columns in grid? no problem!
- **flexbox FTW**
 
**UI stuff:**
- Responsive forms
- Responsive table
- Mobile friendly pagebar
- FontAwesome!
- Some buttons - also mobile friendly if you need

**Mixins for:**
- animation
- border-radius
- box-sizing
- clearing (using :before / :after)
- filters (colors, contrast, ..)
- flexbox
- grandient
- transform
- transition
- user-select


**on way:**
- even more mixins
- even more UI elements (popups, list, menus.. ALL RESPONSIVE)
- ... i dont even know, who can predict future
